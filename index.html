        <hr>
        <p>An info tale is a short, informative story that blends facts with engaging storytelling to explain a concept, event, or idea in an interesting way. It is often used in education, presentations, or content creation to make complex information easier
            to understand and remember. By using characters, simple plots, and real-world relevance, info tales capture attention while delivering key messages. They are especially effective for children or general audiences who benefit from learning
            through narratives. Whether about science, history, health, or technology, an info tale can turn plain facts into a memorable and meaningful learning experience for readers or listeners.
